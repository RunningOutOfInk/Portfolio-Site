    <h1>About Erin Nienhuis</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to erinnienhuis.com!
    </p>

    <p>
      Let me tell you a bit about myself.
    </p>

    <p>
      I grew up on the west coast of Michigan, in a town called Holland. Land of the dutch, most churches per capita in the country, and Tulip Time. I lived within a block of Lake Michigan, so maybe you’d think I spent a lot of time at the beach. I did, but mostly, I’d rather be on my computer. My mom hated it, but my dad encouraged it with his own bad computer habits.
    <p>
    <p>
      I started using PCs from a pretty young age. I learned how to read by playing “Sound It Out Land” and eventually leveled up through other PC games, like Kid Pix, Ski Free, Rodent’s Revenge, Dogz, Catz, and Oddballz. My sister and I vented our aggression with each other by killing each other mercilessly in Jedi Knight multiplayer, and then Unreal Tournament on the Sega Dreamcast after we (my sister, my dad, and I) finally broke my mother into letting us have a gaming console in the house (this was long after the “heyday” of the Dreamcast).
    </p>
    <p>
      In middle school, my friends and I finally started getting on the internet. These were the early days of MSN Messenger, IIRC chat rooms, and social journaling (read: Xanga, LiveJournal). My earliest memories of any type of development are learning how to create websites using GeoCities, and learning how to write in VBA and Logo. My dad was a big influence here too; I remember he helped me set up my first website, and also helped me to excel in my programming class at school. I remember how he helped me to write a piece of code in Logo that resulted in a ball bouncing around the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I started creating websites, I created a bunch! Play-by-post RPGs were my crack, and there was nothing more addicting that getting inspired to create a new site. I loved seeing the cool things that other sites were doing, and learning to replicate them on my own site. I spent hours making minute adjustments in CSS and HTML and seeing what kinds of changes resulted on the webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually I graduated into having a subdomain on a friend’s site, which taught me some website administration and gave me a lot more freedom than the GeoCities in-browser HTML editor. It wasn’t long before I convince my parents to let me buy my very own domain: blue-rabbit.net
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s not much left of that domain, but I was lucky enough to discover an old version of it archived by the Wayback Machine webcrawler. Take a peek at that very early website design of mine!
    </p>
    <p>
      When it came time to make decisions about college and careers, I had some very different ideas about where I wanted to be as a “grown-up.” In addition to my love of the internet, I was (am) an avid reader. Some of my closest friends were my librarians at school. I used to bike to school in the summer just to meet with the librarians and my other friends to talk about the books we were reading each week. I decided that my ultimate career goal was to be a book editor and work for a big publisher in NYC (hi Random House!). I went to school for creative writing and spent those years growing my skills in writing, grammar, and linguistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, I’ve made some major career changes. I’ve ended up as a business analyst and software tester, which is a great career. But the more I think about my future, the more I’ve come to realize that there may be other opportunities out there that are more fulfilling. Thus, welcome to my web development portfolio site!
